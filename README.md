# -ContentBased-Recommendations
In the face of a large number of network text information, the system abandons the simple search method of news unique identification, but establishes the model of [text feature keyword news unique identification], extracts the feature information to form a feature list, writes the weight of the feature value and reverses the feature list, which has two advantages. One is the content that the auxiliary algorithm is interested in for users In the face of a large number of text information, we can narrow the scope of recommendation by analyzing the user characteristics and matching the recall with the feature list. Change the single recommendation strategy, apply the hybrid strategy of recent browsing, favorite articles, and news popularity to recommend, and set up a personalized and perfect recommendation system with different strategy factors according to the user's behavior. Using users' initial news plate settings and recent browsing information to build user feature vector, strengthen the relationship between users and the recommendation system, and set interest attenuation coefficient to improve the recommendation system from the perspective of timeliness. The comparative study shows that the above research on the design of the system can improve the description of the recommended text and has a better recommendation effect.
